# Seismic Detection

This project is implemented to participate in the hackathon [NASA Space Apps 2024](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/). The challenge is [Seismic Detection Across the Solar System](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/seismic-detection-across-the-solar-system/). The task of this challenge is to detect the seismic activity on Moon and Mars. The baseline notebook is extended by the evolutionary algorithm. Good luck!
